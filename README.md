# About

This project was made to simulate an e-shop, it uses and external API https://fakestoreapi.com/ to get the items, images, description, price, etc.

## Dependencies

- bootstrap
- bootstrap-icons

Both dependencies were used to create the UI easily.

### Decisions

At the beginning of the projects it was to be focused on cookies, that's why the name. But along of the project I have found this API that made it easier.
