<h2 align="center">Project Description</h2>

This project was made in order to learn React JS At the beginning of it I've been using [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com/) to simulate an e-shop. Along the journey
I've copied the data from the API to the [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/), where I could manipulate, store and make a better e-shop simulation. 

All items, values, description, prices are from [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com/)
